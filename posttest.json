      "question": "How can overfitting be reduced in machine learning models?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Using a more complex model",
        "b": "Increasing the training data size",
        "c": "Decreasing the number of training epochs",
        "d": "Removing relevant features"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "A complex model increases the risk of overfitting.",
        "b": "Correct! More training data helps the model generalize better.",
        "c": "This might help but is not always a reliable method.",
        "d": "Removing relevant features can lead to underfitting."

      "question": "Which of the following techniques helps prevent underfitting?",

        "a": "Using a more complex model",
        "b": "Reducing the number of features",
        "c": "Decreasing the amount of training data",
        "d": "Reducing the number of training iterations"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! A more complex model can capture more patterns, reducing underfitting.",
        "b": "Reducing features can remove useful information and increase underfitting.",
        "c": "More data helps models learn better and reduces both overfitting and underfitting.",
        "d": "More training iterations allow the model to learn better patterns."

      "question": "What is an ideal characteristic of a well-generalized machine learning model?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Low training accuracy and high test accuracy",
        "b": "High training accuracy but low test accuracy",
        "c": "Similar accuracy on both training and test datasets",
        "d": "A model that memorizes training data completely"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This rarely happens; a generalized model should perform well on both sets.",
        "b": "This indicates overfitting, not generalization.",
        "c": "Correct! A good model should have similar performance on both training and test data.",
        "d": "Memorization leads to overfitting and poor performance on new data."

      "question": "Which dataset is used to evaluate a machine learning model's performance before deployment?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Training set",
        "b": "Test set",
        "c": "Validation set",
        "d": "Entire dataset"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The training set is used for learning, not evaluation.",
        "b": "Correct! The test set is used for final evaluation before deployment.",
        "c": "The validation set is used for hyperparameter tuning, not final evaluation.",
        "d": "Using the entire dataset means no independent evaluation, which is not ideal."

      "question": "Which of the following is an example of an unsupervised learning problem?",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "House price prediction is a supervised regression task.",
        "b": "Spam detection is a supervised classification problem.",
        "c": "Correct! Customer segmentation is a clustering problem, which is unsupervised learning.",
        "d": "Classifying images requires labeled data, making it a supervised task."
