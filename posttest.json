      "question": "A model has very low error on training data but very high error on validation data. This is a clear sign of:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Underfitting",
        "b": "Overfitting",
        "c": "Good generalization",
        "d": "Insufficient regularization strength"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Underfitting shows high error on both training and validation.",
        "b": "Correct! Large gap between training and validation performance indicates overfitting.",
        "c": "Good generalization means similar low error on both sets.",
        "d": "This is a consequence, not the diagnosis."

      "question": "Which of the following is NOT an effective way to reduce overfitting?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Adding dropout layers",
        "b": "Using L2 regularization",
        "c": "Increasing model depth from 10 to 100 layers",
        "d": "Applying early stopping"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Dropout reduces overfitting by randomly ignoring neurons.",
        "b": "L2 regularization penalizes large weights.",
        "c": "Correct! Dramatically increasing model complexity usually worsens overfitting.",
        "d": "Early stopping prevents excessive fitting to noise."

      "question": "In the bias-variance tradeoff, underfitting is mainly caused by:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "High variance",
        "b": "High bias",
        "c": "Low bias and low variance",
        "d": "Too much training data"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "High variance causes overfitting.",
        "b": "Correct! Underfitting occurs when the model is too simple and has high bias.",
        "c": "This is ideal but rare.",
        "d": "More data helps reduce overfitting, not cause underfitting."

      "question": "What is the main purpose of a validation set during training?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To train the model's weights",
        "b": "To make the final performance report",
        "c": "To tune hyperparameters and monitor for overfitting",
        "d": "To replace the test set when data is limited"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Weights are updated only on the training set.",
        "b": "Final report uses the untouched test set.",
        "c": "Correct! Validation set is used for model selection, early stopping, and hyperparameter tuning.",
        "d": "Test set must remain isolated; validation is separate."

      "question": "Which technique directly reduces model variance without significantly increasing bias?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Using a deeper neural network",
        "b": "Collecting more training examples",
        "c": "Switching from a decision tree to a linear model",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Deeper networks increase variance.",
        "b": "Correct! More data is the most effective way to reduce variance (overfitting).",
        "c": "This reduces variance but greatly increases bias.",
        "d": "This increases variance dramatically."

      "question": "A model performs poorly on the training set itself. The best first step to improve it is:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Add strong regularization",
        "b": "Increase model capacity or train longer",
        "c": "Apply dropout",
        "d": "Reduce the learning rate drastically"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Regularization will make performance even worse.",
        "b": "Correct! If training error is high, the model is underfitting — increase capacity or train more training.",
        "c": "Dropout reduces capacity → worsens underfitting.",
        "d": "May slow learning but doesn't solve capacity issue."
